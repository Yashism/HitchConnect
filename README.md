# HitchConnect
## HitchConnect is an application to get rides at a cheaper rate in an environment saving way. In this if a driver is going from Place A to Place B and as a user if he wants a ride to place B or somewhere in the middle, the driver can get the rider and drop him off to his location. In this the empty that was using the road is getting used to help a ride reach his destination at a cheaper rate, with eventually creating less traffic, less pollution, less fuel and eventually helping the environment.
